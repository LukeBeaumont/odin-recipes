         <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This easy apple tart uses shop bought puff pastry 
               to speed things up. Laced with calvados and topped 
               with soft Chantilly. Look out for all-butter puff
               for the best flavour.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the tart</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>200g ready made puff pastry</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp stewed apple/sweet apple sauce</li>
                    <li>6 apples (Cox or Granny Smith), peeled, quartered and cored</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
                    <li>40g butter, cubed</li>
                    <li>1 free-range egg yolk, beaten</li>
                </ul>

        <h4>For the Chantilly cream</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>250ml/9fl oz double cream</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
                    <li>1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
                <li>Roll the puff pastry out on a clean work surface 
                    to a large sheet, 3mm thick. Using a bowl or plate, 
                    cut a circle about 25cm/10in in diameter. Crimp the 
                    edge before turning the whole sheet over and laying 
                    it directly onto a flat baking tray. Chill in the fridge
                    for at least 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the pastry from the fridge and spread the apple 
                    compote all over the base of pastry, leaving a 1cm
                    border at the edge.</li>
                <li>Slice the apples the thickness of a two-pound coin and 
                    place them onto the pastry sheet, fanning them out, starting 
                    from the outside and working in. The apples should overlap 
                    each other. Use the largest slices on the outside and place 
                    the smallest slices in the middle of the tart.</li>
                <li>Once all the apples have been laid out, sprinkle over 
                    the caster sugar and dot with the cubed butter. Brush the 
                    border with the beaten egg and bake in the oven for about 
                    30 minutes, or until golden-brown and risen around the edge.</li>
                <li>For the Chantilly cream, whisk the cream, icing sugar and 
                    seeds from the vanilla pod in a bowl until very soft peaks 
                    form and set aside until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>When ready to serve, place the tart onto a serving 
                    plate. Warm the calvados in a small saucepan. Ignite 
                    the alcohol with a match (be careful of your fingers) and 
                    pour over the tart. Serve with Chantilly cream.</li>
            </ol>
