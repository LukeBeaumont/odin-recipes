                <li>Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. 
                    Butter two 20cm sandwich tins and line with non-stick baking paper.</li>
                
                <li>In a large bowl, beat 200g caster sugar, 200g softened butter,
                         4 beaten eggs, 200g self-raising flour, 1 tsp baking powder 
                         and 2 tbsp milk together until you have a smooth, soft batter.</li>
               
                <li>Divide the mixture between the tins, smooth the surface with a
                     spatula or the back of a spoon.</li>
                
                <li>Bake for about 20 mins until golden and the cake springs back when

                <li>Turn onto a cooling rack and leave to cool completely. </li>

                <li>To make the filling, beat the 100g softened butter until smooth 
                    and creamy, then gradually beat in 140g sifted icing sugar and 
                    a drop of vanilla extract (if you are using it). </li>

                <li>Spread the buttercream over the bottom of one of the sponges.
                     Top it with 170g strawberry jam and sandwich the second sponge on 
                     top.</li>

                <li>Dust with a little icing sugar before serving. Keep in an airtight 
                    container and eat within 2 days.</li>
